# PlaywrightActionsExamples

Covering the most common Playwright-Actions with examples

**As for now**, not all tests are runnable.
some may contains a minimal code just for POC.

I hope in the nearest future to make more tests runable, and add classification for those who aren't.

**Please note**, these examples may will or may not be the best-practice for you.
you should consider each case if it's the best for your needs.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have NodeJs, git, and Chrome browser(required only for a few tests)
2. Execute `git clone https://github.com/ilorwork/PlaywrightActionsExamples.git`
3. Execute `npm i`
4. Execute `playwright install`

## Run Tests

- `npx playwright test` runs all tests on chromium (except some of the browsers tests)
- `npx playwright test -g "<test_name>"` runs a specific test by it's name
